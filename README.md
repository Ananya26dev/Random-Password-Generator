# Random Password Generator

The Random Password Generator Project is a web application that allows users to create strong, random passwords easily. Built with React, this application features a simple and intuitive interface where users can generate a secure password with a single click. The generated password consists of a mix of lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters, ensuring high security.

Users can also copy the generated password to their clipboard using a dedicated button, which provides feedback to confirm the action.
